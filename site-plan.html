      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I am a student, project manager and mother of two young children. My
        life can get pretty busy, how about yours? I know that I am not the only
        parent who is juggling many roles. Keeping piano lessons, soccer
        practice or pajama day at school straight can be overwhelming. That is
        why I am creating a site designed for parents who need to organize their
        lives and schedules to include their kids. One place that can track when
        it is, where it is and other important details. Come! Use a scheduler
        that is designed by parents for parents.
      </p>

      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The target audience for my Parents & Plans site is parents who have to
        juggle one or more kids schedules along with their own. Many parents,
        including myself, find themselves in multiple roles and can feel
        overwhelmed keeping everyone’s plans straight. This site for parents
        provides a place to track all of their kids' schedule needs, including
        type, location and time details. As a busy parent it is comforting to
        know that all the things you need to remember for your child's
        extracurricular, school, church activities, etc. are organized and
        easily accessible. The stress of keeping track of everything you need to
        as a parent and fulfilling your other responsibilities can be
        alleviated. Find more peace of mind by using the Parents & Plans site.

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of Planned, Parents & Plans is to create a better way to
        manage parenting responsibilities with other life responsibilities. This
        means that parents have a place to input, view and organize events and
        activities for their children. Scheduling is more than a day on a
        calendar, we want parents to feel like they have a handle on what is
        happening. We want it to be clear and manageable. Getting organized is a
        great way to alleviate stress, so let’s get to it!
      </p>
      <h2>Easy Does It</h2>
      <p>
        To make things easier we have included a search bar and categories
        section so you can quickly filter by child, activity category, location
        or date. Every detail is at your fingertips while being presented to you
        as simply as needed.
      </p>
      <h2>You Can Do This!</h2>
      <p>
        This site is made for parents, by parents. After going a little batty
        from being a full-time parent, student, and intern, we figured that we
        aren’t the only ones looking for a bit more sanity and clarity when it
        comes to managing our kids' activities. Rest assured we made this with
        you in mind, or rather us in mind, so that should be even better.
        Consider us your new personal cheerleaders. You can do this! And we can
        help!

      <h3>Plans</h3>
      <h2>Step 1: Child</h2>
      <p>
        At Planned we understand that you may have one child or many. Maybe you
        are taking care of children that aren’t your own- like a nanny or opare.
        Whatever your family style is, we want you to feel confident your
        child’s scheduling needs are being met. One of the first steps to
        creating a plan is to input the child’s information. You may put as
        little as a first and last name, or you can add in important home info
        like address and phone number (this can be handy for carpooling
        situations). Once your child is added to the plan, you can start getting
        things on the schedule
      </p>
      <h2>Step 2: Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        We know that every second of your time is valuable. That’s why we have
        created a pain free method to add activities to the schedule. When you
        input an activity you can select the category, location, and activity
        name in a flash. This way when you are managing your little ones
        schedule you can easily access where and when things are happening.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 3: Breathe</h2>
      <p>
        Take a deep breath. You did it! You just started on the path to a more
        organized life. Remember that this tool is just that, a tool for you to
        be your best self. You can be a good parent, employee, co-worker, and
        anything else. Prioritize, organize and get Planned.

        Jessica Reece, Founder
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am an Intern, full-time student and mother. Busy doesn’t even scratch
        the surface. In an effort to feel more confident in my daily parenting
        efforts, I created Planned. Planned is a planner specifically for
        parents, to help get your kids schedules organized. It is customizable
        and easy to use. I can quickly view my day, week, or month as whole, or
        filter by individual child, activity, location, etc.I won’t always be an
        intern and in school, but I know that I will always be juggling
        parenting with personal life. I am grateful for a tool to help me do
        that. I hope you enjoy it too!
