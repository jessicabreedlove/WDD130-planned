          <h2 class="home-headline-1">Mission</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-1">The mission of Planned, Parents & Plans is to create a better way to manage parenting responsibilities with other life responsibilities. This means that parents have a place to input, view and organize events and activities for their children. Scheduling is more than a day on a calendar, we want parents to feel like they have a handle on what is happening. We want it to be clear and manageable. Getting organized is a great way to alleviate stress, so let’s get to it!</p>

          <h2 class="home-headline-2">Easy Does It</h2>
          
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">To make things easier we have included a search bar and categories section so you can quickly filter by child, activity category, location or date. Every detail is at your fingertips while being presented to you as simply as needed.</p>
                    

          <h2 class="home-headline-3">You Can Do This!</h2>
          
          <p class="home-paragraph-3">This site is made for parents, by parents. After going a little batty from being a full-time parent, student, and intern, we figured that we aren’t the only ones looking for a bit more sanity and clarity when it comes to managing our kids' activities. Rest assured we made this with you in mind, or rather us in mind, so that should be even better. Consider us your new personal cheerleaders. You can do this! And we can help!</p>
